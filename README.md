# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sinan Uygun!

I'm a hobbyist in Python programming, web development, and graphic design. I love working on creative projects in my free time.

- **Python**: I enjoy writing Python scripts for personal projects.
- **Web Development**: I create simple and responsive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and usually dive into frameworks like React.
- **Graphic Design**: I design graphics and visuals using tools like Photoshop, Illustrator and sometimes Blender.
